LLM queries can be given any number of custom tags, via the `tags` argument.

Referring to our [example](#show-don't-tell), it would make sense to tag queries based
on both the *subject* and the *student*.

For example, we can make queries as follows,
such that the queries are all sensibly categorized:

CODE

Every query made via the API can then be retrieved at a later stage, using the endpoint
[X](), as follows:

CODE

If you want to simply retreive **all** queries made you can leave the `tags` argument
empty, or if you want to retrieve all queries for a student you can omit the subject tag,
and vice versa.

The [X]() endpoint can be useful for creating prompt *datasets* from production traffic,
as explained in the [Production Data]() section.
