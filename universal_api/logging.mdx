LLM queries can be given any number of custom tags, via the `tags` argument.

Referring to our [example](https://docs.unify.ai/basics/welcome#show-dont-tell),
it would make sense to tag queries based on both the *subject* and the *student*.

For example, we can make queries as follows, such that the queries are all sensibly categorized (tagged):

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNIFY_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@together-ai",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Can you prove the Pythagoras Theorem?"
        }
    ]
    "tags": [
        "maths",
        "john_smith"
    ]
}'
```

In Python, this would look like:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("llama-3-8b-chat@together-ai")
client.generate("Can you prove the Pythagoras Theorem?", tags=["maths", "john_smith"])
```

Every query made via the API can then be retrieved at a later stage, using the
[`/prompt_history`](https://docs.unify.ai/api-reference/benchmarks/get_prompt_history) endpoint, as follows:

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.unify.ai/v0/prompt_history?tags=maths,john_smith' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNIFY_KEY>'
```

Again, in Python this would look like:

```python
import unify
prompts = unify.utils.get_prompt_history("maths", "john_smith")
for prompt in prompts:
    print(prompt)
```

We could also query only `"maths"` and return the maths prompts for *all students*,
or we could query only `"john_smith"` and return the prompts across *all subjects* for this student.

If you want to simply retrieve **all** queries made you can leave the `tags` argument empty,
or if you want to retrieve all queries for a student you can omit the subject tag, and vice versa.

The `/prompt_history`  endpoint can be useful for creating prompt *datasets* from production traffic,
as explained in the [Production Data](https://docs.unify.ai/benchmarking/datasets#production-data) section.
