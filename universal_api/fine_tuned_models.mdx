title: 'Fine-Tuned Models'
---

Fine-tuned models can often outperform generic foundation models in specialized domains.
Thankfully, adding custom fine-tuned models to your universal API is very easy.

We don't yet support *triggering* fine-tuning jobs from our API,
but we do natively support fine-tuned models from all LLM providers,
via our [custom endpoint API](<link-to-custom-endpoints-in-console>) interface.

Below, we show some end-to-end examples for fine-tuning a model via any LLM provider,
and then integrating these fine-tuned models into your unified stack.

### OpenAI

### Anthropic

### Mistral

### AWS Bedrock

### Vertex AI

### Azure ML

### Together AI

### Fireworks AI

### Replicate
