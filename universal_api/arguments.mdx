title: 'Arguments'
---

With so many LLMs and providers constantly coming onto the scene, each of these is
increasingly striving to provide unique value to end users, and this means that there
are often diverging features offered behind the API.

For example, some models support RAG directly in the API,
others support function calling, tool use, image processing, audio,
structured output (such as json mode),
and many other increasingly complex modes of operation.

We *could* adopt a design for our universal API where we only support the lowest common
denominator across all of the APIs. However, this would necessarily leave out many of
the most exciting bleeding edge features, limiting the utility of
our API for more forward-thinking applications.

Similarly, we *could* try to create a universal interface to the full superset of features
across *all* providers, ensuring that the input-output behaviour is consistent regardless
of the backend provider selected. This would require a huge amount of ongoing
maintenance to keep pace with the fast-changing API specs, and the wrong choice of
abstraction for the unification effort could break compatibility across APIs.

We have instead opted for a compromise with our API, where we support:

- [Platform Arguments](#platform-arguments): specific to the Unify platform
- [Unified Arguments](#unified-arguments): from the OpenAI Standard, unifed across **all** endpoints
- [Partially Unified Arguments](#partially-unified-arguments): from the OpenAI Standard, unifed across **some** endpoints
- [Passthrough Arguments](#passthrough-arguments): any extra model-specific or provider-specific arguments,
passed straight through to the backend http request

## Platform Arguments

The following arguments of the chat completions
[endpoint](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/querying_llms/get_completions)
are solely related to the *Unify platform*:

- `signature` specifying how the API was called (Unify Python Client, NodeJS client, Console etc.)
- `use_custom_keys` specifying whether to use custom keys or the unified keys with the provider.
- `tags`: to mark a prompt with string-metadata which can be used for filtering later on.

We therefore refer to them as the *platform* arguments,
to distinguish them from those in the OpenAI Standard (see below).

## Unified Arguments

The *unified* arguments of the chat completions
[endpoint](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/querying_llms/get_completions)
are as follows:

- `model` - The model@provider pair (the endpoint) to use in the backend.
- `messages` - A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.
- `temperature` - What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more
random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
- `stream` - If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they
become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.
- `max_tokens` - The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input
tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
- `stop` - Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

These are all taken directly from the
[OpenAI Standard](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).
The only argument which deviates from OpenAI is `model`, which in the case of OpenAI of course is only OpenAI models,
whereas our API supports all major models and providers in the format `model@provider`.

These arguments are all **fully supported by all models and providers in Unify**.
This means you can switch models and providers totally freely when making use of the *unified arguments*,
without changing the code in any way.

These *unified* arguments are also all mirrored in the
[generate](https://docs.unify.ai/python/clients#generate) function of the
[Unify](https://docs.unify.ai/python/clients#unify) client and
[AsyncUnify](https://docs.unify.ai/python/clients#asyncunify) client
in the Python SDK.

## Partially Unified Arguments

Most arguments in the [OpenAI Standard](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) are only supported
by *some* models and providers, but *not all* of them. These arguments are referred to as *partially* unified, given
that they are unified to the OpenAI standard for the subset of models and providers which support these features (or
support features which are sufficiently similar to be unified into the standard).

These *partially unified* arguments are as follows:

- `frequency_penalty` - Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing
frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
- `logit_bias` - Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from
-100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect
will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100
or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
- `logprobs` - Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities
of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.
- `top_logprobs` - An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token
position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.
- `n` - How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the
number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.
- `presence_penalty` - Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in
the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
- `response_format` - An object specifying the format that the model must output.
Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will
match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.
Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
- `seed` - This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such
that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed,
and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
- `stream_options` - Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.
- `top_p` - An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results
of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are
considered. Generally recommended to alter this *or* temperature, but not both.
- `tools` - A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a
list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
- `tool_choice` - Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tool and
instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
`required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
`{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.
`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.
- `parallel_tool_calls` - Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

Most of these *partially unified* arguments are provider-specific, but others are model specific.

You can see which models and providers support these partially unified arguments in this [live dashboard](),
which is determined directly based on the latest unit tests.

Despite only being supported by some models and providers, these arguments are *also* explicitly mirrored in the
[generate](https://docs.unify.ai/python/clients#generate) function of the
[Unify](https://docs.unify.ai/python/clients#unify) client and
[AsyncUnify](https://docs.unify.ai/python/clients#asyncunify) client
in the Python SDK.

If you believe one of these arguments *could* be supported by a certain model or provider, but is not currently
supported, then feel free to let us know [on discord](https://discord.com/invite/sXyFF8tDtm)
and we'll get it added as soon as possible! âš¡

### Tool Use Example

OpenAI and Anthropic have different interfaces for tool use.
Since we adhere to the OpenAI standard, we accept tools as specified by the OpenAI standard, and convert the format so
that they work with Anthropic models.

This is the default function calling example from OpenAI, working with an Anthropic model:

```python
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_current_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                    },
                    "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]},
                },
            },
        },
    }
]

client = unify.Unify("claude-3.5-sonnet@aws-bedrock")
client.generate("What is the current temperature of New York, San Francisco and Chicago?", tools=tools, tool_choice="auto", message_content_only=False)
```

## Passthrough Arguments

The *passthrough* arguments are not handled by Unify at all, they are *passed through*
directly to the backend provider, without any modification.

There are three types of passthrough arguments:

1) extra headers, which are passed to the `curl` request like so:
    ```shell
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions \
    --header "<header_name>: <value>"
    ...
    ```

2) extra query parameters, which are passed to the `curl` request like so:
    ```shell
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions?<parameter>=<value> \
    ...
    ```

3) extra json properties, which are passed to the `curl` request like so:
    ```shell
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions \
    --data '{
    "<key>": "<value>"
    ...
    ```

In the Python client, these extra arguments are handled by the `extra_headers` argument, `extra_query` argument,
and direct `**kwargs` of the [generate function](https://docs.unify.ai/python/clients#generate), respectively.

### Anthropic-Only Example

Anthropic exposes the `top_k` argument, which isn't provided by OpenAI.
If you include this argument, it will be sent straight to the model.
If you send this argument to a provider that does not support `top_k`, you will get an error.

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNIFY_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "claude-3.5-sonnet@anthropic",
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "Tell me a joke",
            "role": "user"
        }
    ],
    "top_k": 5,
    "max_tokens": 1024,
}'
```

This can also be done in the Unify Python SDK, as follows:

```python
client = unify.Unify("claude-3-haiku@anthropic")
client.generate("hello world!", top_k=5)
```

The same is true for headers. For example, beta features are sometimes released,
which can be accessed via specific headers, as explained in
[this tweet](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1812921642143900036) from Anthropic.

These headers can be queried directly from the Unify API like so:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNIFY_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'anthropic-beta: max-tokens-3-5-sonnet-2024-07-15'
  --data '{
    "model": "claude-3.5-sonnet@anthropic",
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "Tell me a joke",
            "role": "user"
        }
    ]
}'
```

Again, this can also be done in the Unify Python SDK as follows:

```python
client = unify.Unify("claude-3-haiku@anthropic")
client.generate("hello world!", extra_headers={"anthropic-beta": "max-tokens-3-5-sonnet-2024-07-15"})
```

{/* ToDo: add an example for a query parameter, again with both curl + python examples */}

### Multi-Modal Queries

The *passthrough* approach means that Unify also supports multi-modal inputs,
and indeed supports anything which *any* of the providers support via their chat completions API.
Below are a few examples of multi-modal queries, making use of passthrough arguments:

For example, let's use `gpt-4o` to work out what's in this picture:
<p align="left">
    <img width={384} src="/images/nature.png" alt="Nature Image" />
</p>

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai")
response = client.generate(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Whatâ€™s in this image?"},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
          },
        },
      ],
    }
  ],
  max_tokens=300,
)

print(response)
```

We get something like the following:

```
The image depicts a serene landscape featuring a wooden pathway that extends into the distance, cutting through a lush green field.
The field is filled with tall grasses and a variety of low-lying shrubs and bushes.
In the background, there are scattered trees, and the sky above is a clear blue with some wispy clouds.
The scene exudes a calm, peaceful, and natural atmosphere.
```

Let's do the same with `claude-3-sonnet`, with a different image this time:

<p align="left">
    <img width={384} src="/images/ant.jpg" alt="Ant Image" />
</p>

```python
import unify
import base64
import httpx

image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg"
image_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image_data = base64.b64encode(httpx.get(image_url).content).decode("utf-8")

client = unify.Unify("claude-3-sonnet@anthropic")
response = client.generate(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Whatâ€™s in this image?"},
                {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "base64",
                        "media_type": image_media_type,
                        "data": image_data,
                    },
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    max_tokens=300,
)
print(response)
```

We get something like the following:

```
The image shows a close-up view of an ant. The ant appears to be a large black carpenter ant species.
The ant is standing on a light-colored surface, with its mandibles open and antennae extended.
The image captures intricate details of the ant's body segments and legs.
The background has a reddish-brown hue, creating a striking contrast against the dark coloration of the ant.
This macro photography shot highlights the remarkable structure and form of this small insect in great detail.
```
