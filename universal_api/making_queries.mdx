title: 'Making Queries'
---

You can interact with the chat completions API via:

- [HTTP Requests](#http-requests) from any programming language
- Our own [Unify Python Package](#unify-python-package)
- The [OpenAI Python Package](#openai-python-package)
- The [OpenAI NodeJS Package](#openai-nodejs-package)

## HTTP Requests

Run the following command in a terminal (replacing `$UNIFY_KEY` with your own).

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer $UNIFY_KEY' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]
    }'
```

The `model` field is used to specify both the model and the provider, in the format 
`model@provider`. The full specification for this REST API endpoint is available
[here](https://docs.unify.ai/api-reference/querying_llms/get_completions).

See the
[previous section](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/supported_endpoints)
for an explanation on how to list all available models, providers and endpoints
(model + provider pairs).

Requests can easily be made from any language, for example using Python:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.unify.ai/v0/chat/completions"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer UNIFY_KEY",
}
payload = {
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@together-ai",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]
}
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

The response from a request should look something like this:

```python
{
    "model": "llama-3-8b-chat@together-ai",
    "created": 1718888877,
    "id": "896bfc1ae84271aa-LHR",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "usage": {
        "completion_tokens": 25,
        "prompt_tokens": 13,
        "total_tokens": 38,
        "cost": 7.6e-06
    },
    "choices": [
        {
        "finish_reason": "stop",
        "index": 0,
        "message": {
            "content": "Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with or would you like to chat?",
            "role": "assistant",
        },
        "seed": 11563975138181362140
        }
    ]
}
```

The output from the LLM is accessed via `choices[0].message.content`.
The `usage` field contains the number of prompt/completion tokens, as well as
the total cost of the request, in US$.
In the request you can specify other common parameters, like `temperature`, `stream` and
`max_tokens`.

You can specify all of the parameters that OpenAI supports, but they may not be
compatible with every model or provider.
As mentioned above, you can find all arguments in the chat completions
[API reference](https://docs.unify.ai/api-reference/querying_llms/get_completions).

## Unify Python Package

First, download our [Python package](https://github.com/unifyai/unify) with 
`pip install unifyai`. You can then quickly get started like so:

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("llama-3-8b-chat@fireworks-ai", api_key="$UNIFY_KEY")
response = client.generate("hello world!")
```

If you save your API key to the environment variables `UNIFY_KEY`,
then you don't need to specify the `api_key` argument in the example above.

As explained [here](https://docs.unify.ai/universal_api/supported_endpoints),
you can list the models, providers and endpoints using the functions
`unify.utils.list_models()`, `unify.utils.list_providers()` and 
`unify.utils.list_endpoints()`

## OpenAI Python Package

The Unify API is designed to be compatible with the OpenAI standard, so if you 
have existing code that uses the OpenAI Python package, it's straightforward to try 
out our API.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.unify.ai/v0/",
    api_key="UNIFY_KEY"
)

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-405b-chat@fireworks-ai",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi."}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

Remember that the `model` field needs to contain a string of the form `model@provider`.

## OpenAI NodeJS Package

Likewise, if you have existing code that uses the OpenAI NodeJS package, it's again very 
straightforward to try out our API.

```javascript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseUrl: "https://api.unify.ai/v0/",
  apiKey: "UNIFY_KEY"
});

const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "llama-3.1-405b-chat@fireworks-ai",
  messages: [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi."}],
  stream: true
});
```

Again, remember that the `model` field needs to contain a string of the form 
`model@provider`.
