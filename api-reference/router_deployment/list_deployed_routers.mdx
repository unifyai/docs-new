title: 'List Deployed Routers'
api: 'GET /v0/router/deploy/list'
---
Fetches a list of the *deployed* routers and relevant metadata (excluding the
trained but undeployed routers). To fetch a list of *all* trained routers (both
deployed and undeployed), you can use the `/router/list` `GET` endpoint.

To use any of these routers, replace the model in the endpoint string with the
router name. E.g. you can use `router-abc` with the endpoint `router-abc@q:1`.
