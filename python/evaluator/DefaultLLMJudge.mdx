            **kwargs
    ) -> Union[Evaluation, EvaluationSet]:
```

Evaluate the given response for this input prompt, with optional extra data.

**Arguments**:

- `prompt` - The user message or the full input prompt being responded to.
- `response` - The response which is being evaluated, either as just the most
- `agent` - The agent that made the response, which is being evaluated.
- `kwargs` - Extra information relevant to the prompt, as is stored in the Datum.



**Returns**:

An Evaluation instance, containing the prompt, response, agent, score and
optional extra data used during the evaluation.

### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(
            self,
            client: Union[Unify, AsyncUnify]
    ):
```

Create a default Judge, which uses a standard task-agnostic score and a generic
system prompt. This should judge work okay on a range of tasks, but the best
performance will be achieved by subclassing LLMJudge and creating your own.

**Arguments**:

- `client` - The client which holds the LLM used under the hood for judging.
