Generate content using the Unify API.

**Arguments**:

- `user_prompt` - A string containing the user prompt.
  If provided, messages must be None.
  
- `system_prompt` - An optional string containing the system prompt.
  
- `messages` - A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. If
  provided, user_prompt must be None.
  
- `frequency_penalty` - Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new
  tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the
  model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
  
- `logit_bias` - Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the
  completion. Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token
  ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100.
  Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior
  to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and
  1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or
  100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
  
- `logprobs` - Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not.
  If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the
  content of message.
  
- `top_logprobs` - An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most
  likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log
  probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.
  
- `max_tokens` - The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat
  completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited
  by the model's context length. Defaults to the provider's default max_tokens
  when the value is None.
  
- `n` - How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note
  that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all
  of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.
  
- `presence_penalty` - Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new
  tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the
  model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
  
- `response_format` - An object specifying the format that the model must output.
  Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables
  Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON
  schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide. Setting to
  `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the
  model generates is valid JSON.
  
- `seed` - If specified, a best effort attempt is made to sample
  deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and
  parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and
  you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor
  changes in the backend.
  
- `stop` - Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
  
- `stream` - If True, generates content as a stream. If False, generates content
  as a single response. Defaults to False.
  
- `stream_options` - Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set
- `stream` - true.
  
- `temperature` - What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.
  Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,
  while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
  It is generally recommended to alter this or top_p, but not both.
  Defaults to the provider's default max_tokens when the value is None.
  
- `top_p` - An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling,
  where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability
  mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass
  are considered. Generally recommended to alter this or temperature, but not
  both.
  
- `tools` - A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are
  supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may
  generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
  
- `tool_choice` - Controls which (if any) tool is called by the
  model. none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a
  message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or
  calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more
  tools. Specifying a particular tool via
  `{ "type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"} }`
  forces the model
  to call that tool.
  none is the default when no tools are present. auto is the default if tools
  are present.
  
- `parallel_tool_calls` - Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool
  use.
  
- `use_custom_keys` - Whether to use custom API keys or our unified API keys
  with the backend provider.
  
- `tags` - Arbitrary number of tags to classify this API query as needed. Helpful
  for generally grouping queries across tasks and users, for logging purposes.
  
- `message_content_only` - If True, only return the message content
  chat_completion.choices[0].message.content.strip(" ") from the OpenAI
  return. Otherwise, the full response chat_completion is returned.
  Defaults to True.
  
- `extra_headers` - Additional "passthrough" headers for the request which are
  provider-specific, and are not part of the OpenAI standard. They are handled
  by the provider-specific API.
  
- `extra_query` - Additional "passthrough" query parameters for the request which
  are provider-specific, and are not part of the OpenAI standard. They are
  handled by the provider-specific API.
  
- `kwargs` - Additional "passthrough" JSON properties for the body of the
  request, which are provider-specific, and are not part of the OpenAI
  standard. They will be handled by the provider-specific API.
  

**Returns**:

  A dictionary of responses from each of the LLM clients.
  

**Raises**:

- `UnifyError` - If an error occurs during content generation.
