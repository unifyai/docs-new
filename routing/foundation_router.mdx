title: 'Foundation Router'
---

We have trained a general-purpose router on a wide variety of prompts. 
To query the foundation router, select a green star on the graph on the 
[chat interface](https://unify.ai/chat) and copy the router string.

For example `router@q:1|c:4.65e-03|t:2.08e-05|i:2.07e-03`

The parameters stand for the relative weighing of: quality, cost, time-to-first-token, 
and inter-token latency. They are completely customizable, but itâ€™s most meaningful to 
select a configuration directly from the graph.


### Filtering endpoints

You can restrict the model and providers that are routed between, by specifying them in 
the router string as follows: 

`router@models:model1,model2,model3|providers:provider1,provider2`


### Maximising throughput

When using the router, if provider specific rate-limits are hit then the router moves on 
to the next best model. This means that you can get much higher throughput than is 
available from a single provider.
