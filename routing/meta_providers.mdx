title: 'Fallbacks'
---

Sometimes individual providers have outages,
which can disrupt live workflows in production.

To combat this, you can set a list of fallback models,
so if one provider is down or fails for some reason,
the request will go to the next model on the list, and so on, until either the
request succeeds, or the end of the list is reached.

To specify the list of fallback models, use `->` between individual model tags, so the
model string becomes `model_a@provider_a->model_b@provider_b`.

There is no limit on the number of models that can be specified.
The `model` field in the response contains the model and provider that the request
actually went to.
