title: 'Billing'
---

You only have to manage the balance and billing details for your Unify account, 
and we handle the spending with each provider behind the scenes.

You can see your balance, top-up your balance, and set automatic refill on the 
[billing page](https://console.unify.ai/billing).

You can also get your current credit balance with a HTTP request:

```shell
curl -X 'GET' \
    'https://api.unify.ai/v0/get_credits' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

which will return something like:

```json
{
    "id": "your_user_id",
    "credits": 232.32
}
```

This is also supported in our Python client:

```python
import unify
credits = unify.utils.get_credits()
```
