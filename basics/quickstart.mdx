It's easiest to get started using our Python client. Simply install the package:

```bash
pip install unifyai
```

[Sign up](https://console.unify.ai) to get your API key. Then you're ready to go! ðŸš€

```python
import unify
client = unify.Unify("gpt-4o@openai", api_key=<your_key>)
client.generate("hello world!")
```

You can also save your key as `UNIFY_KEY` in your environment variables, avoiding the need 
to use the `api_key` argument.

You can list all available endpoints like so, any of which can be passed into the client:

```python
import unify
import random
endpoints = unify.utils.list_endpoints()
endpoint = random.choice(endpoints)
client = unify.Unify(endpoint)
client.generate("hello world!")
```

That's it! You now have all models and providers at your fingertips âœ¨
