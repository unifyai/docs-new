{"prompt": "Which element is essential for plant growth and is a key component of chlorophyll?", "ref_answer": "This question is worth \n1\n \n\n\n1 mark: Nitrogen\n\nAdditional guidance for markers:\n- Accept only \"nitrogen\" as the correct answer.\n- Do not award the mark for other elements like phosphorus or potassium, even though they are also important for plant growth.\n- Do not accept chemical symbols (e.g., \"N\") in place of the full element name.\n- The answer does not need to mention chlorophyll explicitly, as the question already states this connection.\n"}
{"prompt": "What is one common raw material used in the industrial production of fertilizers?", "ref_answer": "This question is worth \n1\n \n\n\n1 mark: Ammonia\n\nAdditional guidance for markers:\n- Accept \"NH3\" as an alternative to \"ammonia\"\n- Also accept \"natural gas\" or \"methane\" as these are common sources of hydrogen for ammonia production\n- Do not accept \"nitrogen\" or \"hydrogen\" alone, as these are elements used to produce ammonia rather than direct raw materials\n- Do not accept \"air\" alone, although it is a source of nitrogen\n\nIf students mention ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulfate, these can be accepted as they are mentioned in the syllabus point, but encourage them to think about the raw materials used to produce these compounds in future.\n"}
{"prompt": "What is the main purpose of conducting a life-cycle assessment of a material or product?", "ref_answer": "This question is worth 1 \n\n\n1 mark: To assess the environmental impact of a material or product throughout its entire life cycle\n\nAdditional guidance for markers:\n- Accept answers that clearly convey the idea of evaluating environmental impact across all stages of a product's life\n- Accept mentions of resource use and environmental effects if linked to the whole life cycle\n- Do not award the mark for vague answers about \"helping the environment\" without mentioning assessment or evaluation\n- Do not accept answers that focus on only one stage of the life cycle (e.g., just production or disposal)\n\n"}
{"prompt": "What is the primary purpose of a life-cycle assessment for a material or product?", "ref_answer": "This question is worth \n1\n \n\n\n1 mark: To evaluate the environmental impact of a material or product throughout its entire life cycle\n\nAdditional guidance for markers:\n- Accept answers that clearly convey the idea of assessing environmental impact across all stages of a product's life.\n- Key phrases to look for: \"environmental impact,\" \"entire life cycle,\" \"from production to disposal.\"\n- Do not award the mark for vague answers like \"to assess a product\" without mentioning environmental impact or life cycle.\n- Accept reasonable alternatives such as \"to determine the sustainability\" or \"to measure the ecological footprint\" of a material or product.\n"}
