GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science)
We appreciate that one size doesn’t fit all so we offer
two suites of qualifications in each science:
Physics A (Gateway Science) – Provides a flexible
approach to teaching. The specification is divided
into topics, each covering different key concepts of
physics. Teaching of practical skills is integrated with
the theoretical topics and they are assessed through
the written papers.
Physics B (Twenty First Century Science) – Learners
study physics using a narrative-based approach.
Ideas are introduced within relevant and interesting
settings which help learners to anchor their
conceptual knowledge of the range of topics required
at GCSE level. Practical skills are embedded within
the specification and learners are expected to carry
out practical work in preparation for a written
examination that will specifically test these skills.
All of our specifications have been developed with
subject and teaching experts. We have worked in
close consultation with teachers and other
stakeholders with the aim of including up-to-date
relevant content within a framework that is
interesting to teach and easy to administer
within all centres.
Our new GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science)
qualification builds on our existing popular course.
We’ve based the redevelopment of our GCSE sciences
on an understanding of what works well in centres
large and small. We’ve undertaken a significant
amount of consultation through our science forums
(which include representatives from: learned
societies, HE, teaching and industry) and through
focus groups with teachers.
The content is clear and logically laid out for both
existing centres and those new to OCR, with
assessment models that are straightforward to
administer. We have worked closely with teachers
to provide high quality support materials to guide
you through the new qualifications.
1b. Why choose an OCR GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science)?
Aims and learning outcomes
GCSE study in the sciences provides the foundation
for understanding the material world. Scientific
understanding is changing our lives and is vital to
world’s future prosperity, and all learners should be
taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods,
process and uses of science. They should be helped to
appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena
of the natural world can be described in terms of a
small number of key ideas relating to the sciences
which are both inter-linked, and are of universal
application.
These key ideas include:
• the use of conceptual models and theories to
make sense of the observed diversity of natural
phenomena
• the assumption that every effect has one or
more cause
• that change is driven by differences between
different objects and systems when they
interact
• that many such interactions occur over a
distance and over time without direct contact
• that science progresses through a cycle of
hypothesis, practical experimentation,
observation, theory development and review
• that quantitative analysis is a central element
both of many theories and of scientific
methods of inquiry
OCR’s GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science) will
encourage learners to:
• develop scientific knowledge and conceptual
understanding of physics
13Version 4.2 © OCR 2024
GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science)
• develop understanding of the nature, processes
and methods of science, through different
types of scientific enquiries that help them to
answer scientific questions about the world
around them
• develop and learn to apply observational,
practical, modelling, enquiry and
problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in
the field and in other learning environments
• develop their ability to evaluate claims based
on science through critical analysis of the
methodology, evidence and conclusions, both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
14Version 4.2 © OCR 2024
GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science)
Our GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science)
specification is designed with a concept-led
approach and provides a flexible way of teaching.

• is co-teachable with the GCSE (9–1) in
Combined Science A (Gateway Science)
• embeds practical requirements within the
teaching topics
• identifies opportunities for carrying out
practical activities that enhance learners’
understanding of physics theory and
practical skills
• highlights opportunities for the introduction of
key mathematical requirements (see Appendix
5g and the To include column for each topic)
into your teaching
• identifies, within the Working scientifically
column, how the skills, knowledge and
understanding of Working Scientifically (WS)
can be incorporated within teaching.

GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science)
Physics is the science of the fundamental concepts
of field, force, radiation and particle structures,
which are inter-linked to form unified models of
the behaviour of the material universe. From such
models, a wide range of ideas, from the broadest
issue of the development of the universe over time
to the numerous and detailed ways in which new
technologies may be invented, have emerged. These
have enriched both our basic understanding of, and
our many adaptations to, our material environment.
Students should be helped to understand how,
through the ideas of physics, the complex and
diverse phenomena of the natural world can be
described in terms of a small number of key ideas
which are of universal application and which can
be illustrated in the separate topics set out below.
These ideas include:
• the use of models, as in the particle model of
matter or the wave models of light and of
sound
• the concept of cause and effect in explaining
such links as those between force and
acceleration, or between changes in atomic
nuclei and radioactive emissions
• the phenomena of ‘action at a distance’ and
the related concept of the field as the key to
analysing electrical, magnetic and gravitational
effects
• that differences, for example between
pressures or temperatures or electrical
potentials, are the drivers of change
• that proportionality, for example between
weight and mass of an object or between
force and extension in a spring, is an important
aspect of many models in science
• that physical laws and models are expressed in
mathematical form.

GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science) 2c. Content of topics P1 to P9
Topic P1: Matter
P1.1 The particle model
Summary
Knowledge and understanding of the particle nature of matter is fundamental to
physics. Learners need to have an appreciation of matter in its different forms,
they must also be aware of subatomic particles, their relative charges, masses
and positions inside the atom. The structure and nature of atoms are essential to
the further understanding of physics. The knowledge of subatomic particles is
needed to explain many phenomena, for example the transfer of charges, as well
as radioactivity. (Much of this content overlaps with that in the GCSE (9–1) in
Chemistry A (Gateway Science content.)
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be aware of the atomic model, and that atoms are examples of
particles. They should also know the difference between atoms, molecules and
compounds. Learners should understand how density can be affected by the state
materials are in.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly confuse the different types of particles (subatomic particles,
atoms and molecules) which can be addressed through the teaching of this topic.
They commonly misunderstand the conversions between different units used in
the measurement of volume.
Tiering
Statements shown in bold type will only be tested in the Higher Tier papers.

GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science) P1.2 Changes of state
Summary
A clear understanding of the foundations of the physical world forms a solid basis
for further study of physics. Understanding of the relationship between the states
of matter helps to explain different types of everyday physical changes that we
see around us.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the structure of matter and the similarities and
differences between solids, liquids and gases. They should have an idea of the
particle model and be able to use it to model changes in particle behaviour during
changes of state. Learners should be aware of the effect of temperature in the
motion and spacing of particles and an understanding that energy can be stored
internally by materials.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly carry misconceptions about matter: assuming atoms are
always synonymous with particles. Learners also struggle to explain what is
between the particles, instinctively ‘filling’ the gaps with ‘air’ or ‘vapour’. They
often struggle to visualise the 3D arrangement of particles in all states of matter.
Learners can find it challenging to understand how kinetic theory applies to
heating materials and how to use the term temperature correctly, regularly
confusing the terms temperature and heat.
Tiering
Statements shown in bold type will only be tested in the Higher Tier papers.
All other statements will be assessed in both Foundation and Higher Tier papers.

Summary
This section develops the understanding of pressure in gases and liquids. Pressure
in gases builds on the particle model, and in liquids the increase in pressure with
depth is explained as the weight of a column of liquid acting on a unit area.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be aware of the change in pressure in the atmosphere and
in liquids with height (qualitative relationship only). They should have an
understanding of floating and sinking and the effect of upthrust. Learners
should know that pressure is measured by a ratio of force over area which is
acting at a normal to the surface.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly have misconceptions about floating and sinking, based
on the premise that light or small objects float and heavy or large objects sink.
They often misunderstand the role of pressure difference and suction e.g. the
collapsing can experiment and the forcing of air into the lungs during inhalation.

Topic P2: Forces
P2.1 Motion
Summary
Having looked at the nature of matter which makes up objects, we move on to
consider the effects of forces. The interaction between objects leads to actions
which can be seen by the observer, these actions are caused by forces between
the objects in question. Some of the interactions involve contact between the
objects, others involve no contact. We will also consider the importance of the
direction in which forces act to allow understanding of the importance of vector
quantities when trying to predict the action.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
From their work in Key Stage 3 Science, learners will have a basic knowledge of
the mathematical relationship between speed, distance and time. They should
also be able to represent this information in a distance-time graph and have an
understanding of relative motion of objects.
Common misconceptions
Learners can find the concept of action at a distance challenging. They have a
tendency to believe that a velocity must have a positive value and have difficulty
in associating a reverse in direction with a change in sign. It is therefore important
to make sure learners are knowledgeable about the vector–scalar distinction.

GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science) P2.2 Newton’s laws
Summary
Newton’s laws of motion essentially define the means by which motion changes
and the relationship between these changes in motion with force and mass.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should have an understanding of contact and non-contact forces
influencing the motion of an object. They should be aware of the newton and
that this is the unit of force. The three laws themselves will be new to the
learners. Learners are expected to be able to use force arrows and have an
understanding of balanced and unbalanced forces.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly have misconceptions about objects needing a net force for
them to continue to move steadily and can struggle to understand that stationary
objects also have forces acting on them. Difficulties faced by learners when trying
to differentiate between scalar and vector quantities is the idea of objects with
a changing direction not having a constant vector value, for example, objects
moving in a circle. This issue also arises with the concept of momentum and
changes in momentum of colliding objects.

GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science) P2.3 Forces in action
Summary
Forces acting on an object can result in a change of shape or motion. Having
looked at the nature of matter, we can now introduce the idea of fields and
forces causing changes. This develops the idea that force interactions between
objects can take place even if they are not in contact. Learners should be
familiar with forces associated with deforming objects, with stretching and
compressing (springs).
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should have an understanding of forces acting to deform objects and to
restrict motion. They should already be familiar with Hooke’s Law and the idea
that, when work is done by a force, it results in an energy transfer and leads to
energy being stored by an object. Learners are expected to know that there is a
force due to gravity and that gravitational field strength differs on other planets
and stars.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly have difficulty understanding that the weight of an object
is not the same as its mass from the everyday use of the term ‘weighing’.
The concept of force multipliers can also be challenging even though the basic
concepts are ones covered at Key Stage 3.

Topic P3: Electricity
P3.1 Static and charge
Summary
Having established the nature of matter, consideration is now given to the
interactions between matter and electrostatic fields. These interactions are
derived from the structure of matter which was considered in Topic P1. The
generation of charge is considered. Charge is a fundamental property of matter.
There are two types of charge which are given the names ‘positive’ and ‘negative’.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be aware of electron transfer leading to objects becoming
statically charged and the forces between them. They should also be aware of
the existence of an electric field.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly have difficulty classifying materials as insulators or
conductors. They find it difficult to remember that positive charge does not move
to make a material positive, rather it is the movement of electrons.

P3.2 Simple circuits
Summary
Electrical currents depend on the movement of charge and the interaction of
electrostatic fields. Electrical current, potential difference and resistance are all
discussed in this section. The relationship between them is considered and
learners will investigate this using circuits.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should have been introduced to the measurement of conventional
current and potential difference in circuits. They will have an understanding of
how to assemble series and parallel circuits and of how they differ with respect to
conventional current and potential difference. Learners are expected to have an
awareness of the relationship between potential difference, current and
resistance and the units in which they are measured.
Common misconceptions
Learners find the concept of potential difference very difficult to grasp. They
find it difficult to understand the behaviour of charge in circuits and through
components and how this relates to energy or work done within a circuit.

Topic P4: Magnetism and magnetic fields
P4.1 Magnets and magnetic fields
Summary
Having an understanding of how charge can be generated and its effects, we can
now consider the link between movement of charge and magnetism. To begin,
learners will investigate magnets and magnetic fields around magnets and
current-carrying wires.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should have been introduced to magnets and the idea of attractive and
repulsive forces. They should have an idea of the shape of the fields around bar
magnets. Learners are expected to have an awareness of the magnetic effect of a
current and electromagnets.
Common misconceptions
Common misconceptions that learners have include the idea that larger magnets
will always be stronger magnets. They also have difficulty understanding the
concept of field line density being an indicator of field strength. Learners often
do not know that the geographic and magnetic poles are not located in the
same place.

GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science) P4.2 Uses of magnetism
Summary
Forces show the existence of fields and how they interact with one another but
here the force itself is discussed in more depth and then quantified. These forces
also lead to the use of magnetic fields to induce electrical currents and the
applications of this electromagnetic induction in motors, dynamos and
transformers.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
This topic will predominantly be new content for learners with some
understanding of D.C. motors. Learners will have looked at fields in the
previous subtopic and now this knowledge will be built on to give learners the
understanding of the application.
Common misconceptions
Learners find understanding the manner in which electric and magnetic fields
interact to produce a force challenging. Learners commonly have difficulty
with the right angles and three-dimensional requirements of Fleming’s left-hand
rule. Their ability to visualise this will impact how they deal with this concept.
Learners find the action of a commutator difficult to apply in the D.C. motor. The
application of changing direction of field in the transformer is found challenging
by many learners and hence often leads to a superficial grasp of the working of
the transformer.

Topic P5: Waves in matter
P5.1 Wave behaviour
Summary
Waves are means of transferring energy and the two main types of wave are
introduced in this section: mechanical and electromagnetic. This section
considers both what these types of waves are and how they are used. The
main terms used to describe waves are defined and exemplified in this topic.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should have prior knowledge of transverse and longitudinal waves
through sound and light. Learners should be aware of how waves behave and
how the speed of a wave may change as it passes through different media.
They may already have knowledge of how sound is heard and the hearing
ranges of different species.
Common misconceptions
Although they will often have heard of the terms ultrasound and sonar, learners
find it challenging to explain how images and traces are formed and to apply
their understanding to calculations. Learners often misinterpret distance and
displacement–time graphical presentations of waves.

GCSE (9–1) in Physics A (Gateway Science) P5.2 The electromagnetic spectrum
Summary
Having looked at mechanical waves, waves in the electromagnetic spectrum are
now considered. This section includes the application of electromagnetic waves
with a specific focus on the behaviour of light. Alongside this, it explores the
application of other types of electromagnetic radiation for use in medical imaging.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners may be familiar with uses of some types of radiation but an
understanding of all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum is not expected
and should be taught as new content.
Common misconceptions
Learners can have misconceptions such as gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet light,
visible light, infrared light, microwaves and radio waves being independent
entities and not being able to view it as a spectrum. They struggle to link the
features that waves have in common, alongside the differences and how these
relate to their different properties.

Summary
Having studied the electromagnetic spectrum learners now go on to look at the
interactions of waves with materials, this will include absorption, refraction and
reflection. Learners will also be expected to draw ray diagrams to illustrate the
refraction of rays through lenses.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners will already be familiar with the properties and behaviour of light. They
are expected to have an understanding of behaviour such as reflection, refraction,
absorption and scattering. Learners should know that colours are produced by
light at different frequencies.
Common misconceptions
A common misconception is that when light passes through a coloured filter, the
filter will add colour to the light. In addition, learners are often confused about
which colours are primary colours.

Summary
Having considered the general characteristics of waves and particles, we now
move on to look at radioactive decay which combines these two ideas. The idea
of isotopes is introduced, leading into looking at the different types of emissions
from atoms.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should have prior understanding of the atomic model, chemical symbols
and formulae. An understanding of radioactivity is not expected and should be
taught as new content.
Common misconceptions
Learners tend to struggle with the concept that radioactivity is a random and
unpredictable process. The idea of half-life is another area that can lead to
confusion. Learners often find it difficult to understand that objects being

P6.2 Uses and hazards
Summary
We now address the hazards and applications of radioactive decay. The processes
of fission and fusion as a source of energy are also considered.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners may have prior understanding of the term radioactivity from the
previous sub topic and may be familiar with some uses, but will not have
covered this content prior to this topic.
Common misconceptions
Learners tend to think that radioactivity will always cause physical mutations
when humans or animals come into contact with it. They tend to only think of
the negative impacts of radiation and not the positive uses.

Topic P7: Energy
P7.1 Work done
Summary
We now move on to consider how energy can be stored and transferred. This
topic acts to consolidate the ideas of energy that have been covered in previous
topics as it is a fundamental concept that underpins many of the ways in which
matter interacts.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners may have prior knowledge of energy listed as nine types, as this is the
teaching approach often taken at Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 to increase
accessibility to an abstract concept. Learners may find it difficult to move away
from this idea but need to be able to approach systems in terms of energy
transfers and stores. They will have an understanding that energy can be
transferred in processes such as changing motion, burning fuels and in electrical
circuits. Learners should also be aware of the idea of conservation of energy and
that it has a quantity that can be calculated.
Common misconceptions
Learners may have misconceptions around energy being a fuel-like substance
that matter has to ‘use up’, that resting objects do not have any energy and that
all energy is transferred efficiently. There is also often confusion between forces
and energy.

P7.2 Power and efficiency
Summary
This considers the idea of conservation and dissipation of energy in systems and
how this leads to the efficiency. Ways of reducing unwanted energy transfers and
thereby increasing efficiency will be explored.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be aware of the transfer of energy into useful and waste
energies. They will have an understanding of power and how domestic appliances
can be compared. Learners will have knowledge of insulators and how energy
transfer is influenced by temperature. They should have an awareness of ways to
reduce heat loss in the home.
Common misconceptions
Learners have the common misconception that energy can be “used up” or that
energy is truly lost in many energy transformations. They also tend to have the
belief that energy can be completely changed from one form to another with no
energy dissipated.

Topic P8: Global challenges
This topic seeks to integrate learners’ knowledge and understanding of physical systems and processes, with the aim of applying it to global challenges. Applications of
physics can be used to help humans improve their own lives and strive to create a sustainable world for future generations, and these challenges are considered in this
topic. It therefore provides opportunities to draw together the concepts covered in earlier topics, allowing synoptic treatment of the subject of physics.
P8.1 Physics on the move
Summary
Learners will use their knowledge of forces and motion to develop their ideas
about how objects are affected by external factors. They will develop a better
understanding of these external factors to be able to understand how the design
of objects such as cars may be modified to operate more safely.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with how forces affect motion of objects. They will
also need to have a good understanding of momentum from P2.2. Learners may
already have some knowledge of how vehicles are adapted to increase safety.
Common misconceptions
Learners tend to confuse the factors that affect thinking distance and braking
distance, thinking that alcohol, drugs and tiredness will affect braking distance
rather than thinking distance. It needs to be made clear the distinction between
these two terms and that the combination of these gives us the stopping
distance.

P8.2 Powering Earth
Summary
We are reliant on electricity for everyday life and this topic explores the
production of electricity. Consideration will be given to the use of non-
renewable and renewable sources and the problems that are faced in the
efficient transportation of electricity to homes and businesses. Safe use of
electricity in the home is also covered in this topic. It may be an opportunity
to revisit power and efficiency.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should already be familiar with renewable and non-renewable energy
sources. Learners are expected to have a basic understanding of how power
stations work and the cost of electricity in the home. They may have some idea
of electrical safety features in the home.
Common misconceptions
Learners often confuse the idea of energy with terms including the word power
such as solar power. There are often difficulties in understanding that higher
voltages are applied across power lines and not along them. Another common
misconception is that batteries and wall sockets have current inside them ready
to escape.

Summary
In this astrophysics topic learners will look in more detail at how we can
investigate the characteristics of planets. To begin with learners will investigate
bodies that are close to our own planet and consider factors that affect natural
and artificial satellites. The topic then moves onto considering bodies within the
universe, and will apply their knowledge of fusion processes to understand the
life cycle of a star and waves to consider black body radiation. The Big Bang
theory will be studied and the evidence that supports it as a scientific theory.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should already be familiar with the bodies within our own solar system
and the behaviour of satellites. They may have a basic understanding of the Big
Bang theory and that distances to other celestial bodies are large.
Common misconceptions
A common misconception among learners is that the Sun is not a star but a
separate entity; it needs to be instilled in learners that the sun is a star. In
addition, learners have difficulty grasping how far away celestial objects are.
