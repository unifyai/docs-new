B1.1 Cell structures
Summary
Cells are the fundamental units of living organisms. Cells contain many sub-
cellular structures that are essential for the functioning of the cell as a whole.
Microscopy is used to examine cells and sub-cellular structures.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with cells as the fundamental unit of living organisms,
and with the use of light microscopes to view cells. They should also be familiar
with some sub-cellular structures, and the similarities and differences between
plant and animal cells.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly have difficulty understanding the concept of a cell as a
3D structure, so this should be addressed during the teaching of this topic.

Summary
Life processes depend on biological molecules whose structure is related to
their function. Inside every cell is genetic material and this is used as a code to
make proteins. Enzymes are important proteins in biology.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should have a simple understanding of the double helix model
of DNA. Learners should be familiar with the idea of enzymes as biological
catalysts.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly hold the misconception that DNA is made of protein or
sugar. Learners also think that all enzymes have an optimum temperature of 37°C
(human body temperature). The range of optimum temperatures of enzymes
should be introduced through the teaching of this topic and further addressed
when considering homeostatic mechanisms for controlling temperature.

Summary
Cells transport many substances across their membranes by diffusion, osmosis
and active transport. Stem cells are found in both plants and animals. These
stem cells can divide, differentiate and become specialised to form tissues,
organs and organ systems.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the role of diffusion in the movement of
materials in and between cells.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly show some confusion regarding surface area: volume ratio,
particularly how larger animals have a smaller surface area: volume ratio. They
also show some confusion as to stem cells: where they are found and their roles.

Summary
When organisms become multicellular, the need arises for highly adapted
structures including gaseous exchange surfaces and transport systems, enabling
living processes to be performed effectively.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the role of diffusion in the movement of
materials in and between cells. They should also be familiar with the human
gaseous exchange system.
Common misconceptions
Learners have a view that the slow flow of blood in capillaries is due to the
narrow diameter, when in fact it is a function of the total cross-sectional area
of the capillaries (1000 times greater than the aorta). When explaining the
importance of the slow flow of blood in allowing time for exchange by diffusion,
this misunderstanding should be considered.

Summary
The human nervous system is an important part of how the body communicates

Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should have a concept of the hierarchical organism of multicellular
organisms from cells to tissues to organs to systems to organisms.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly think that their eyes see objects ‘directly’, like a camera,
but the reality is that the image formed by the brain is based on the eyes and
brains interpretation of the light that comes into the eye i.e. different people
will perceive the same object or image differently. Young learners also have
the misconception that some sort of ‘force’ comes out of the eye, enabling
it to see.

temperature, blood sugar levels and osmotic balance are regulated by a number
of organs and systems working together.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners will build on the knowledge and understanding gained in section 3.1
about coordination and control when considering the topics in this section.
Common misconceptions
Learners often confuse type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and the effective treatments
for each. The effect of ADH on the permeability of the kidney tubules is often
confused.

Topic B4: Community level systems
B4.1 Ecosystems
Summary
Microorganisms play an important role in the continuous cycling of chemicals
in ecosystems. Biotic and abiotic factors interact in an ecosystem and have an
effect on communities. Living organisms form populations of single species,
communities of many species and are part of ecosystems. Living organisms are
interdependent and show adaptations to their environment. Feeding
relationships reflect the stability of an ecosystem and indicate the flow of
biomass through the ecosystem.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the idea of a food web and the interrelationships
associated with them and that variation allows living things to survive in the
same ecosystem. They should also recognise that organisms affect their
environment and are affected by it.
Common misconceptions
Research has shown that it is easier for a learner to explain the consequences
on a food web if the producers are removed for some reason than if the top
predators are taken away. It is also better to start off explaining ideas relating to
food webs using small simple webs with animals and plants that learners are
likely to know e.g. rabbits and foxes. Learners find arrows showing the flow of
biomass from one trophic level to another quite challenging and often mistake it
for the direction of predation. This makes problems relating to the manipulation
of a food web quite difficult for some.

GCSE (9–1) in Biology A (Gateway Science) Topic B5: Genes, inheritance and selection
B5.1 Inheritance
Summary
Inheritance relies on the genetic information contained in the genome
being passed from one generation to the next, whether sexually or asexually.
The characteristics of a living organism are influenced by the genome and its
interaction with the environment.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the idea of heredity as the process by which
genetic information is passed from one generation to the next. They should
have a simple model of chromosomes, genes and DNA.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly struggle to appreciate the physical relationships between
the nucleus, genetic material, the genome, chromosomes and genes. Accurate
definitions of these terms will help learners’ explanations in this topic. Learners
often have well-developed (although not necessarily scientifically accurate)
explanations for inheritance before undertaking GCSE study. Some examples
include that intra-specific variation is as a result of defects in development or
that acquired characteristics can be inherited. Care must also be taken with the
concept of dominant and recessive alleles. Whether an allele is dominant or
recessive does not affect the mechanism of inheritance of the allele, but is an
observed pattern in the phenotype of organisms. Many learners assume that the
dominant allele ‘dominates’ the recessive allele preventing its expression (which
is not the case) or that the recessive allele is actually just an absence of the
dominant allele (also not generally the case).

Summary
Variation in the genome and changes in the environment drive the process
of natural selection, leading to changes in the characteristics of populations.
Evolution accounts for both biodiversity and how organisms are all related to
varying degrees. Key individuals have played important roles in the development
of our understanding of genetics.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should appreciate that changes in the environment can leave some
individuals, or even some entire species, unable to compete and reproduce
leading to extinction.
Common misconceptions
Learners are used to hearing the term evolution in everyday life but it is often
used for items that have been designed and gradually improved in order to fit a
purpose. They therefore find it difficult to grasp the idea that evolution by natural
selection relies on random mutations. Learners also tend to imply that individuals
change by natural selection. Statements such as ‘a moth will change by natural
selection in order to become better camouflaged’ include both of these common
misconceptions.

This topic seeks to integrate learners’ knowledge and understanding of biological
systems and processes, with the aim of applying it to global challenges. Biological
information is used to help people to improve their own lives and strive to create
a sustainable world for future generations. This topic provides opportunities to
draw together the concepts covered in earlier topics, allowing synoptic treatment
of the subject.
B6.1 Monitoring and maintaining the environment
Summary
Living organisms interact with each other, the environment and with humans
in many different ways. If the variety of life is to be maintained we must
actively manage our interactions with the environment. We must monitor our
environment, collecting and interpreting information about the natural world,
to identify patterns and relate possible cause and effect.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
From their study in topic B4, learners should be familiar with ecosystems and the
various ways organisms interact. They should understand how biotic and abiotic
factors influence communities. Learners should be familiar with the gases of the
atmosphere from Key Stage 3.
Common misconceptions
It is important that in the study of this topic learners are given opportunities to
explore both positive and negative human interactions within ecosystems.

B6.3 Monitoring and maintaining health
Summary
Diseases affect the health of populations of both humans and plants.
Scientists are constantly on the lookout for ways of preventing and combating
disease. The prevention of disease in plants is important so that we are
able to grow healthy plants enabling us to feed ourselves and enhance our
environment. The understanding of how disease is spread, how our bodies
defend themselves against disease and how immunity is achieved is essential to
enable us to combat potentially fatal diseases spreading throughout whole
populations. Non-communicable diseases also have an impact on the health of
the population. The prevention of these diseases is frequently discussed
in the media, with advice being given to us on how to reduce our risk of
contracting these diseases through our life-style choices and discussion of new
technologies.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the effects of ‘recreational’ drugs (including
substance misuse) on behaviour, health and life processes, the impact of exercise,
asthma and smoking on the gas exchange system and the consequences of
imbalances in the diet, including obesity, starvation and deficiency diseases.
Common misconceptions
Research has shown that learners tend to view all micro-organisms as being
non-beneficial. They tend to consider health as just physical and do not consider
mental health. Learners also confuse which diseases are inherited and which are
caught. They see cancer as a genetic disease.
