GCSE (9–1) in Chemistry A (Gateway Science) C1.2 Atomic structure
Summary
An atom is the smallest component of an element that gives an element its
property. These properties can be explained by models of atomic structure.
Current models suggest that atoms are made of smaller sub-atomic particles
called protons, neutrons and electrons. They suggest that atoms are composed
of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus is composed of neutrons and
protons. Atoms of each element have the same number of protons as electrons.
Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. Atoms of the
same element will have the same number of protons but may have different
numbers of neutrons.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the simple (Dalton) atomic model.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly have difficulty understanding the concept of isotopes due
to the fact they think that neutral atoms have the same number of protons and
neutrons. They also find it difficult to distinguish between the properties of
atoms and molecules. Another common misconception is that a positive ion gains
protons or a negative ion loses protons i.e. that there is a change in the nucleus of
the atom rather than a change in the number of electrons.

GCSE (9–1) in Chemistry A (Gateway Science) Topic C2: Elements, compounds and mixtures
C2.1 Purity and separating mixtures
Summary
In chemical terms elements and compounds are pure substances and mixtures
are impure substances. Chemically pure substances can be identified using
melting point. Many useful materials that we use today are mixtures. There
are many methods of separating mixtures including filtration, crystallisation,
distillation and chromatographic techniques.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the concept of pure substances. They should
have met simple separation techniques of mixtures: filtration, evaporation and
distillation. The identification of pure substances in terms of melting point, boiling
point and chromatography will also have been met before.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly misuse the word pure and confuse it with natural substances
or a substance that has not been tampered with. They think that when a
substance dissolves that the solution is pure and not a mixture.

C2.2 Bonding
Summary
A simple electron energy level model can be used to explain the basic chemical
properties of elements. When chemical reactions occur, they can be explained in
terms of losing, gaining or sharing of electrons. The ability of an atom to lose, gain
or share electrons depends on its atomic structure. Atoms that lose electrons will
bond with atoms that gain electrons. Electrons will be transferred between the
atoms to form a positive ion and a negative ion. These ions attract one another in
what is known as an ionic bond. Atoms that share electrons can bond with other
atoms that share electrons to form a molecule. Atoms in these molecules are held
together by covalent bonds.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the simple (Dalton) atomic model. They should
be familiar with the principles underlying the Mendeleev Periodic Table and the
modern Periodic Table including periods and groups, and metals and non-metals.
Learners should have some knowledge of the properties of metals and
non-metals including the chemical properties of metal and non-metal oxides with
respect to acidity.
Common misconceptions
Learners do not always appreciate that the nucleus of an atom does not change
when an electron is lost, gained or shared. They also find it difficult to predict
the numbers of atoms that must bond in order to achieve a stable outer level of
electrons. Learners think that chemical bonds are physical things made of matter.
They also think that pairs of ions such as Na+ and Cl - are molecules. They do not
have an awareness of the 3D nature of bonding and therefore the shape of
molecules.

Topic C3: Chemical reactions
C3.1 Introducing chemical reactions
Summary
A chemical equation represents, in symbolic terms, the overall change in a
chemical reaction. New materials are formed through chemical reactions but
mass will be conserved. This can be explained by a model involving the
rearrangement of atoms. Avogadro gave us a system of measuring the amount
of a substance in moles.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with chemical symbols and formulae for elements and
compounds. They should also be familiar with representing chemical reactions
using formulae and equations. Learners will have knowledge of conservation of
mass, changes of state and chemical reactions.
Common misconceptions
Although learners may have met the conservation of mass they still tend to refer
to chemical reactions as losing mass. They understand that mass is conserved but
not the number or species of atoms. They may think that the original substance
vanishes ‘completely and forever’ in a chemical reaction.

reactions.

Learners commonly have the idea that energy is lost or used up. They do not
grasp the idea that energy is transferred. Learners also wrongly think that energy
is released when bonds break and do not link this release of energy with the
formation of bonds. They also may think for example that a candle burning is
endothermic because heat is needed to initiate the reaction.

Summary
Chemical reactions can be classified according to changes at the atomic and
molecular level. Examples of these include reduction, oxidation and neutralisation
reactions.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with combustion, thermal decomposition, oxidation
and displacement reactions. They will be familiar with defining acids and alkalis in
terms of neutralisation reactions. Learners will have met reactions of acids with
alkalis to produce a salt and water and reactions of acids with metals to produce a
salt and hydrogen. They should have met the pH scale for measuring acidity and
alkalinity, and some indicators.
Common misconceptions
Learners commonly intuitively adhere to the idea that hydrogen ions in an acid
are still part of the molecule, not free in the solution. They tend to have little
understanding of pH, for example, they tend to think that alkalis are less corrosive
than acids. Learners also may think that the strength of acids and bases and
concentration mean the same thing.

Topic C4: Predicting and identifying reactions and products
C4.1 Predicting chemical reactions
Summary
Models of how substances react and the different types of chemical reactions
that can occur enable us to predict the likelihood and outcome of a chemical
reaction. The current Periodic Table was developed based on observations of
the similarities and differences in the properties of elements. The way that the
Periodic Table is arranged into groups and periods reveals the trends and
patterns in the behaviour of the elements. The model of atomic structure
provides an explanation for trends and patterns in the properties of elements.
The arrangement of elements in groups and periods reveals the relationship
between observable properties and how electrons are arranged in the atoms
of each element.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the principles underpinning the Mendeleev
Periodic Table; the Periodic Table: periods and groups; metals and non-metals;
the varying physical and chemical properties of different elements; the chemical
properties of metals and non-metals; the chemical properties of metal and
non-metal oxides with respect to acidity and how patterns in reactions can be
predicted with reference to the Periodic Table.
Common misconceptions
Learners consider the properties of particles of elements to be the same as
the bulk properties of that element. They tend to rely on the continuous matter
model rather than the particle model. Learners confuse state changes and
dissolving with chemical changes. Also, since the atmosphere is invisible to the
eye and learners rely on concrete, visible information, this means they therefore
often avoid the role of oxygen in their explanations for open system reactions.
Even if the role of oxygen is appreciated, learners do not realise that solid
products of an oxidation reaction have more mass than the starting solid.

C4.2 Identifying the products of chemical reactions
Summary
Types of substances can be classified according to their general physical and
chemical properties. This section explores the tests that can be used to identify
the products of reactions by looking at their physical and chemical properties.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with cations and anions from their work on
electrolysis.
Common misconceptions
Learners confuse mass and density so in reactions involving change of state,
learners reason that the products from a precipitation reaction are heavier than
the starting materials and that when a gas is produced the reaction has lost mass
overall.

Topic C5: Monitoring and controlling chemical reactions
C5.1 Monitoring chemical reactions
Summary
This topic tackles the relationship of moles to the concentration of a solution
and the volume of a gas. It also tackles the calculation of the mass of a substance
in terms of its molarity. The topic then moves on to look at using equations to
make predictions about yield by calculations and to calculate atom economy.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the mole from Topic C3 and know that it
measures the amount of substance. They should be familiar with representing
chemical reactions using formulae and using equations.
Common misconceptions
The most common problem learners’ encounter with these calculations is their lack
of understanding of ratios. Also most learners think that the mole and mass are the
same thing. This is reinforced by use of phrases such as ‘1 mole is 12 g of carbon,
‘1 mole is the relative atomic mass in grammes’ or ‘1 mol = 12 g C’ in teaching and
in textbooks equating amount of substance to mass, portion of substance, number
of particles (Avogadro’s number) or number of moles. All these phrases reinforce
the idea that amount of substance is a measure of mass or a number.

Summary
The rate and yield of a chemical reaction can be altered by changing the physical
conditions.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the action of catalysts in terms of rate of
reaction. They should know the term surface area and what it means.
Common misconceptions

Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners will be familiar with representing chemical reactions using formulae and
using equations.
Common misconceptions
Learners often do not recognise that when a dynamic equilibrium is set up in a
reaction the concentration of the reactants and products remain constant.
They think that the concentrations of all substances are equal. Learners also
sometimes perceive a dynamic equilibrium as two reactions.

Topic C6: Global challenges
This topic seeks to integrate learners’ knowledge and understanding of
chemical systems and processes, with the aim of applying it to global challenges.
Applications of chemistry can be used to help humans improve their own lives
and strive to create a sustainable world for future generations, and these
challenges are considered in this topic. It therefore provides opportunities to
draw together the concepts covered in earlier topics, allowing synoptic treatment
of the subject of chemistry.
C6.1 Improving processes and products
Summary
Historically, new materials have been developed through trial and error,
experience etc. but as our understanding of the structure of materials and
chemical processes has improved we are increasing our ability to manipulate
and design new materials. Industry is continually looking to make products that
have a better performance and are sustainable to produce. This section also
explores the extraction of raw materials and their use in making new products.
Underlying knowledge and understanding
Learners should be familiar with the properties of ceramics, polymers and
composites. They should have knowledge of the order of metals and carbon in
the reactivity series. Learners should have met the method of using carbon to
obtain metals from metal oxides. They should also be aware that the Earth has
limited resources and the benefits of recycling materials.
Common misconceptions
Learners often think that chemical reactions will continue until all the reactants
are exhausted. They also think that equilibrium is a static condition.
